This is a minecraft mod built for 1.18.2.

This mod uses Fabric.

The idea of this mod is to allow the player to maintain a checklist of all the items in the game.

The checklist state will be stored in local storage, and the player can give a name for each checklist.

Optionally, if the required API keys are provided, I'm planning to clone the state into a google sheet.

Everything will be running on the client only.
